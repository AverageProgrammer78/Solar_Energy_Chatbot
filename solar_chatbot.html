Your installer handles all permit applications - this bureaucratic step takes 2-6 weeks but requires nothing from you. When permits arrive, installation happens fast - typically 1-3 days for a residential system. Crews work efficiently, mounting panels, wiring systems, and installing your inverter. After a quick inspection and utility interconnection approval (2-4 weeks), you flip the switch! The whole journey is usually 2-3 months, and your installer manages everything.",
                    "From decision to solar power, here's the timeline: First, free consultations and system design (1 week). Then permitting - your installer submits all paperwork to local authorities (2-6 weeks). Installation day arrives and takes just 1-3 days - teams mount panels, install inverters, connect everything, and test the system. You'll barely notice them! Finally, inspection and grid connection approval (2-4 weeks). Most systems are generating power within 60-90 days of signing. Your installer coordinates everything, so it's hassle-free for you!"

Rain naturally keeps them clean in most areas, but if you're in a dusty location, an occasional rinse with a garden hose is all you need. Most manufacturers recommend a professional inspection every 3-5 years, but it's not always necessary. Solar panels are warrantied for 25 years and typically last 30-35 years while maintaining 80-85% efficiency. The inverter may need replacement after 10-15 years (cost: $1,000-$2,000), but that's your only significant maintenance expense. It's truly set-it-and-forget-it!",

They're self-cleaning in most climates thanks to rain. If needed, spray them with water once or twice a year. No chemicals, no scrubbing required. The panels themselves have no moving parts and are extremely durable. Most come with 25-year performance warranties and 10-12 year equipment warranties. They'll keep producing power for 30+ years with efficiency only gradually declining. Besides a possible inverter replacement midway through, maintenance costs are near zero!",

They're weatherproof, durable, and self-sufficient. Occasional rain keeps them clean - dust and debris wash right off. If you live in a very dusty area, hosing them down 1-2 times a year maintains peak performance. No chemicals, no special equipment needed. The panels have 25-30 year lifespans, and inverters last 10-15 years. Total maintenance costs over the system's life are usually under $2,000. It's hands-off solar power!"

Rain actually helps by cleaning your panels naturally! In winter, panels can be more efficient because they work better in cold temperatures (though shorter days mean less total production). Snow usually slides right off tilted panels, or melts quickly since panels generate heat. Even in cloudy cities like Seattle, solar makes great financial sense!",

On overcast days, you'll still produce 10-25% of your peak capacity - that's more than enough to offset your usage. Annual production is what matters, and sunny days more than compensate for cloudy ones. Rain is actually beneficial, keeping panels clean. Snow typically melts quickly or slides off due to the panel angle and heat. At night, you simply draw from the grid using credits earned during the day. The system is designed to work year-round in all weather!",

The key is annual production - sunny summer days produce excess power that makes up for winter's shorter days. Rain keeps panels clean and doesn't hurt production. Snow rarely sticks to tilted panels and melts quickly. Even in less sunny regions, solar provides excellent returns.
