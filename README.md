This is a chatbot that talks about solar energy and answers questions about green energy, solar power etc...
It is in development stages as it is part of an MVP project.
Right now, it uses key words based on input to generate responses, but once I get a viable key from a known API (OpenAI, Gemini).
It is my first ever project so please enjoy!
